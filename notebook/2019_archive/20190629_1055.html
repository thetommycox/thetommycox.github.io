oddly correct<br>
ethiopia, jigesa natural<br><br>

25g coffee, 458g water (definitely didn't mean to add this much water, oops)<br>
1+6 on lido e-t<br>
water at 198 deg f<br><br>

botched recipe that didn't turn out half-bad<br>
71g bloom for 45s<br>
at 45s, pour to 250g<br>
at 1m 25s, pour to 325g<br>
at 1m 45s, pour to 400g but accidentally overfill because you're not paying attention<br>
3m 20s total brew time - removed filter a little early to try and keep a good ratio without overextracting<br><br>

overall impressions: more mild than usual, still picked up on a lot of fruitiness surprisingly<br>
just a tad bitter, which was to be expected with my botched ratio<br>
trying to figure out how i messed this up so bad anD IT STILL MADE AN AWESOME CUP WHAT<br>
eight and a half stars out of ten
