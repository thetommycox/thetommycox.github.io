<font color="dodgerblue">cold brew<br><br>

<font color=white>
cafe rey<br>
costa rica selecto, dark<br><br>

92g coffee, 940g water<br>
2+0 on lido e-t<br><br>

in 2019.09.27 13:32<br>
brewed in three ~30g batches in mason jars in the refrigerator<br>
out 2019.09.28 11:24<br>
filtered through a chemex<br>
ended with 1 and 2/3 pints concentrate<br><br>

overall impressions to be added<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;cup 1: made morning of 2019.09.29<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;poured over ice in travel mug, ~1/3 of a pint of concentrate, 10oz total<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pretty solid - one of the better batches of cold brew i've made<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;cup 2: made morning of 2019.09.30<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;poured over ice in travel mug, ~1/3 of a pint of concentrate, 10oz total<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this one was incredible, need to remember ~3oz ice<br>
<!-- &nbsp;&nbsp;cup 3: made morning of 2019.08.29<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;poured about one-third of a pint over ice, filled approximately 1/4 of remaining volume with water<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;larger total cup, maybe a little more off-balance than previously
&nbsp;&nbsp;cup 4: made morning of 2019.08.30<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;poured over a full glass of ice, no water added<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;definitely more bitter, stronger taste - needs dilution
&nbsp;&nbsp;cup 3: made morning of 2019.08.31<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;poured the remainder over a glass of ice, filled about 1/4 with water<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;very balanced and smooth, getting some smoky and caramel notes -->
