overall impressions<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;cup 1: made morning of 2019.08.27<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;poured one-quarter of a pint over ice, filled approximately 1/4 of remaining volume with water<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;very strong and smooth, pretty balanced and very earthy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;cup 2: made morning of 2019.08.28<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;poured one-quarter of a pint over ice, filled approximately 1/4 of remaining volume with water<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;more charred and burnt flavors than the last cup, but not unbearable<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;cup 3: made morning of 2019.08.29<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;poured about one-third of a pint over ice, filled approximately 1/4 of remaining volume with water<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;larger total cup, maybe a little more off-balance than previously
